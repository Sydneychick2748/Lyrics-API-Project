# Lyrics-API-Project

## Description

Fat Music is a website for anyone who wants to listen to their favorite music and see the lyrics, play a sample of the song and look at their favorite artist's music hits and albums. You can also see some fun facts about your favorite artist as well. Check out the live site here:.............
When you visit the page, the user can add in the input of their favorite artist, and the artist of choice is pulled for the API genius. Then, the user can choose to see the lyrics of a song from that artist or see more songs from that artist. They can also see fun facts about the artist of choice; that information was pulled from the ninja API.
This website is excellent for people who just want to look for the albums and songs of their favorite artists and see everything in one place. Also, it's fun to look up different artists and see the lyrics of the songs .
We used the genius API for the song lyrics images and hit songs and the ninja API for the fun facts. We used javascript to make this website.

## Installation

To set up the development environment and we as a group had to put someone in charge of GitHub, and they created the repo. Then we got a copy of the repo in GitHub, which we pushed into our own and made our branches in the terminal. Then we could work on our copies and push them into the main when we needed the updates. Then in vs. code, we made the coding environment. First, we set up my  HTML file: index.html, and then we have an assets folder; in the assets folder is a CSS folder with a styles.css file and an image folder with two images, one for the header image and one for the URL tab. Also, there is a js folder with a scripts.js file in the assets folder.
